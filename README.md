BitShrink: Advanced File Optimizer & Huffman Compressor

This C++ project is a comprehensive File Management and Optimization utility that focuses on data efficiency through advanced compression and resizing techniques. It implements the Huffman Coding algorithm to provide lossless file compression and decompression, enabling significant reductions in storage size while ensuring bit-perfect restoration of original data.

Additionally, the tool integrates with Ghostscript and ImageMagick to offer specialized lossy compression for PDFs and images (JPG, PNG), allowing users to target specific file sizes in KB or MB by dynamically adjusting quality levels. The application features a robust console-based interface for managing these tasks and includes a file verification module to ensure data integrity
